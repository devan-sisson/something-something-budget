/**
 * What are the basic attributes of a budget?
 * 
 *  - budget items
 *  - 
 * 
 * 
 * better yet: 
 * as a user I can:
 *  - build a list of monthly budget items
 *  - define how many paychecks I have to work with
 *  - determine which budget item is paid by which paycheck
 *  - "check off" if a budget Item has been funded
 *  - "check off" if a budget Item has been paid
